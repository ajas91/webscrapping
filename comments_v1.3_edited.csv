1. Value For Money Is High According To The Foods Quality.
2. Packaging For Fries Makes It Soggy Till The Time It Gets Delivered.
3. Taste Could Have Been Better.
4. Avoid Using Sweet Buns For Burgers.
5. Patties Inside The Burger Weren't Juicy.

These are not complaints just a feed back. Thank You.",
