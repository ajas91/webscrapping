23,Hi
24,الاكل طبخ بأيادي لذيذة والتغليف جبد جدا ولكن عندي ملاحظة مهمة جدا ! انا زبونة دائمة ولكن اي طلبات سندويتشات شوارما او حتى الصاروخ ! يجي بدون مخلل ! ياريت لو تحطوا مخلل لانه ماعتقد يخسر كثير بحجم الكمية اللي ترسلوها للشوارما العربي ! تفاصيل بسيطة تفرق عند الزبون وماتكلف صاحب المال

619,Since a few months the food isn't delicious anymore. Before they had great food but now it is really disappointing. Tasteless and a minimum of sauce. This is really a pity. Was the chef replaced ?
